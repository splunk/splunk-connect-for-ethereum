                        "documentation": "@dev Called by {IRelayHub} to validate if this recipient accepts being charged for a relayed call. Note that the\nrecipient will be charged regardless of the execution result of the relayed call (i.e. if it reverts or not).\n     * The relay request was originated by `from` and will be served by `relay`. `encodedFunction` is the relayed call\ncalldata, so its first four bytes are the function selector. The relayed call will be forwarded `gasLimit` gas,\nand the transaction executed with a gas price of at least `gasPrice`. `relay`'s fee is `transactionFee`, and the\nrecipient will be charged at most `maxPossibleCharge` (in wei). `nonce` is the sender's (`from`) nonce for\nreplay attack protection in {IRelayHub}, and `approvalData` is a optional parameter that can be used to hold a signature\nover all or some of the previous values.\n     * Returns a tuple, where the first value is used to indicate approval (0) or rejection (custom non-zero error code,\nvalues 1 to 10 are reserved) and the second one is data to be passed to the other {IRelayRecipient} functions.\n     * {acceptRelayedCall} is called with 50k gas: if it runs out during execution, the request will be considered\nrejected. A regular revert will also trigger a rejection.",

The relayed call will be forwarded `gasLimit` gas,\nand the transaction executed with a gas price of at least `gasPrice`. `relay`'s fee is `transactionFee`, and the\nrecipient will be charged at most `maxPossibleCharge` (in wei). `nonce` is the sender's (`from`) nonce for\nreplay attack protection in {IRelayHub}, and `approvalData` is a optional parameter that can be used to hold a signature\nover all or some of the previous values.\n     * Returns a tuple, where the first value is used to indicate approval (0) or rejection (custom non-zero error code,\nvalues 1 to 10 are reserved) and the second one is data to be passed to the other {IRelayRecipient} functions.\n     * {acceptRelayedCall} is called with 50k gas: if it runs out during execution, the request will be considered\nrejected. A regular revert will also trigger a rejection.",

The relayed call will be forwarded `gasLimit` gas, and the transaction executed with a gas price of at least `gasPrice`. `relay`'s fee is `transactionFee`, and the recipient will be charged at most `maxPossibleCharge` (in wei). `nonce` is the sender's (`from`) nonce for replay attack protection in {IRelayHub}, and `approvalData` is a optional parameter that can be used to hold a signature over all or some of the previous values.     * Returns a tuple, where the first value is used to indicate approval (0) or rejection (custom non-zero error code, values 1 to 10 are reserved) and the second one is data to be passed to the other {IRelayRecipient} functions.     * {acceptRelayedCall} is called with 50k gas: if it runs out during execution, the request will be considered rejected.
